Mission Statement: The goal of the desalph.mf project is to create a
customizable meta-font, using METAFONT, for printing of Deseret
Alphabet manuscripts.

Inspiration: desalph.mf will not be influenced primarily by the
38-character version of the Deseret Alphabet used to print the books
in 1868-69; rather it will look to earlier charts and handwritten
texts for inspiration.

Applications: The first application will be to print the whole of the
Thales H. Haskell journal, written in a 40-character version of the
Deseret Alphabet in 1859.  desalph.mf will eventually include options,
selectable via setting of boolean variables in the parameter file, to
select from a variety of letter forms found in the pre-book variants
of the alphabet.

First version that I'd show to anyone.  At the end of the exercise, I
felt that I was just starting to get the hang of METAFONT.
